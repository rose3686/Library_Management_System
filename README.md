# Introduction⭐
The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to manage a library's inventory of books, member information, and borrowing records. This document outlines the database structure, relationships between tables, and sample queries to demonstrate how the system functions.
# Database Structure
The LMS database consists of three main tables: Books, Members, and Borrowing. These tables are related to one another to ensure data integrity and facilitate complex queries.
